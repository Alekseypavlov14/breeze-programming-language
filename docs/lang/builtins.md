# Builtins

Breeze **builds in** a lot of useful functions to work with application environment. All the tasks that require interaction with the computer require **builtins**.

**Builtins** are Python functions or constants that are wrapped as **Breeze** units. They are executed and added to every app stack before module execution and so that are available in every module without imports.

Most of **builtins** are named is the way not to be used in source code. It is highly recommended to use **standard library** modules if it is possible. Standard library modules are also ```.br``` modules that use **builtins** to provide an access to the environment.
