# Literals

In Breeze, literal types are **numbers**, **strings**, **booleans** and **null**.

## Numbers

Numbers are specified like in most Programming languages:

```ts
var age = 14
var pi = 3.14
```

## Strings

Strings can be made with both with single and double quotes:

```ts
var name = "Alex"
var city = 'New York'
```

## Booleans

Breeze uses ```true``` and ```false``` keywords.

## Null

Null is used as lack of value, is specified using ```null``` keyword.
